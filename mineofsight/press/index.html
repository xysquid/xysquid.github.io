<h4> Presskit for Mine of Sight, a game by ZBlip </h4>

<p>

Puzzle game based on the classic familiar Minesweeper, but with an extended set of hint-types. Minesweeper's weird cousin.

The game has premade levels in a 10 by 10 grid. The campaign levels slowly introduce new hint-types.

Currently there are 100+ campaign levels. It also includes a random level generator called Minesweeper++ that allows you to include or exclude certain hint-types. Also included is a level editor and access to community-made levels.

Free browser game.

First version was released in Dec 2016.

Above picture shows off a lot of hint-types. </p>
<p>  The crown tells you the biggest unbroken sequence that it can see. </p>
<p>  The 'eyebracket' reports how many unbroken sequences that it sees. </p>
<p>  The heart sees only 'lonely mines', mines that have 0 neighbor mines in the 4 cardinal directions. </p>
<p>  The blue rectange merges 2 tiles into 1 big tile. </p>
<p>  The blue compass tells you how many directions it sees mines in.

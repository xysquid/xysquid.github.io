<h4> Presskit for Mine of Sight, a game by ZBlip </h4>

<p></p></p>

Puzzle game based on the classic familiar Minesweeper, but with an extended set of hint-types. Minesweeper's weird cousin.
</p></p>
The game has premade levels in a 10 by 10 grid. The campaign levels slowly introduce new hint-types.
</p></p>
Currently there are 100+ campaign levels. It also includes a random level generator called Minesweeper++ that allows you to include or exclude certain hint-types. Also included is a level editor and access to community-made levels.
</p></p>
Free browser game.
</p></p>
First version was released in Dec 2016.

Above picture shows off a lot of hint-types. </p>
<p>  The crown tells you the biggest unbroken sequence that it can see. </p>
<p>  The 'eyebracket' reports how many unbroken sequences that it sees. </p>
<p>  The heart sees only 'lonely mines', mines that have 0 neighbor mines in the 4 cardinal directions. </p>
<p>  The blue rectange merges 2 tiles into 1 big tile. </p>
<p>  The blue compass tells you how many directions it sees mines in. </p>
<p>  The pink circles tell you how many mines are shared between two hints </p>
<p>  The lightning bolt reports the number of mines reachable by mine-to-mine contact </p>
